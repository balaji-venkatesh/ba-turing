% VerticalSliderClass - Class that that implements vertical sliders.  The
%                       original SliderWidget was the work of teacher Greg
%                       Clarke.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The external interface of VerticalSliderClass is as follows:
%   procedure Show - Display the widget.
%   procedure Hide - Hide the widget.
%   procedure Dispose - Hide the widget and free any data structures allocated
%                       by the class.  To be called before the Widget is freed.
%   procedure SetPosition (x, y : int) - Move the widget to (x, y).
%   procedure SetSize (width, height : int) - Resize the widget.
%   procedure SetPositionAndSize (x, y, width, height : int) - Move and resize
%                                                              the widget.
%   procedure Enable - Allow slider to be slid by user.
%   procedure Disable - Stop user from changing slider value.
%   procedure Initialize (x, y, length, min, max, startValue : int,
%                         newActionProc : proc x (sliderValue : int))
%                       x, y - The location of the start of the slide
%                       length - The length ofthe slide
%                       min, max - The minimum and maximum value of the slider.
%                       startValue - The initial value of the thumb.
%   function GetSliderValue : int - Return the current value of the slider.
%   procedure SetSliderValue (value : int) - Set the value of the slider.
%   procedure SetSliderMinMax (min, max : int) - Set the sliders min/max
%                                                values.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The package interface of VerticalSliderClass is as follows:
%   function ConsiderButtonDown (x, y : int) : boolean
%                       x, y - The location of of the mouse when the button
%                              was pressed.
%                       Handle the mouse button being pressed.  If it occured
%                       in the widget, handle the event.  Return true if the
%                       event is handled by this function.  Return false
%                       otherwise.  If the widget was pressed, call the
%                       actionProc for this widget.
%   function ConsiderKeystroke (key : char) : boolean
%                       key - The key pressed.
%                       Handle a keystroke. If the keystroke is the
%                       shortcut for the widget (or the user pressed ENTER and
%                       this is the default widget), the actionProc for the
%                       widget is called and the function returns true,
%                       otherwise it returns false.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The inheritable subprograms of VerticalSliderClass are as follows:
%   procedure AssertFailed (msg : string) - Quit program with error message.
%   procedure DrawPressedBorder - Draws a pressed raised button border.
%   procedure DrawUnpressedBorder - Draws a raised button border.
%   procedure DrawWidget - Draw the widget.
%   procedure EraseWidget - Erase the widget.
%   procedure DrawWidget - Draw the widget.
%   procedure ComputeWidgetPosition - Compute the location of widget, etc.
%   procedure DrawThumb - Draw the thumb
%   procedure CalculateThumbPosition - Calculate the thumb position from the
%       current scroll value.
%   function InThumb (mx, my : int) : boolean - returns whether the
%       point (mx, my) is located in the thumb of the slider
%   function CloseToSlider (mx, my : int) : boolean - returns whether the
%       point (x, y) is located near enough to the slider
%   function GetSliderValueFromMouse (mx, my : int) : int - returns the slider
%       value corresponding to the change in mouse position
%   body procedure SetOriginalMouseDownForThumb (mx, my : int) - called when
%       the user first puts the mouse down in the thumb
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The inheritable variables of VerticalSliderClass are as follows:
%   originalX, originalY - The x, y values specified by the user.
%   originalWidth, originalHeight - The width, height values specified by the
%                                   user.
%   x, y - The location of the lower left corner of the widget.
%   width, height - The width and height of the widget.
%   showing - Is the widget visible.
%   initialized - Has the widget been initialized.
